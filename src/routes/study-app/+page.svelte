				type: 'short-answer',
				question: "List and define Aristotle's three principles of association.",
				answer:
					'The three principles of association are similarity, contrast, and contiguity. Similarity refers to the idea that objects or events that are similar tend to be associated in the mind. Contrast involves associating ideas or events that are different from each other. Contiguity means that things that occur close together in time or space are often linked in thought.'
			},
			{
				type: 'short-answer',
				question: 'Define and contrast the schools of thought of Empiricism and Nativism.',
				answer:
					'Empiricism holds that knowledge comes from sensory experiences and is learned. Nativism argues that some knowledge is innate and present at birth. Empiricists believe that the environment shapes learning, while nativists believe that certain structures of the mind are hardwired.'
			},
			{
				type: 'short-answer',
				question: 'Define what the Associationists believed about sensations and memory.',
				answer:
					'Associationists believed that sensations and memory are linked through associations formed by principles such as similarity, contrast, and contiguity. They theorized that thoughts are connected to one another in the mind, creating memory networks.'
			},
			{
				type: 'short-answer',
				question: "Describe Ebbinghaus' procedure to study memory.",
				answer:
					'Ebbinghaus used nonsense syllables to test memory and learning by observing how long it took to memorize lists of these syllables, and how quickly they were forgotten. He tested himself repeatedly over time to measure retention.'
			},
			{
				type: 'short-answer',
				question:
					'Outline how Ebbinghaus tested and supported each of the following principles: Frequency, Recency, Contiguity.',
				answer:
					'Ebbinghaus tested frequency by repeating lists and found that items repeated more often were more likely to be remembered. He tested recency by measuring how recently an item was learned and found that items learned more recently were recalled better. He tested contiguity by testing associations between items learned close together in time and found that closer items were more strongly associated.'

			{
				type: 'short-answer',
				question: 'What are three reasons that we should use animals as research subjects?',
				answer:
					'1. Animal models provide insight into basic biological processes. 2. Animals can be used in controlled experiments that would not be ethical in humans. 3. Animal research has led to important medical and psychological discoveries.'
			},
			{
				type: 'short-answer',

			},
			{
				type: 'short-answer',
				question: 'What are feature detectors? Give an example of one.',
				answer:
					'Feature detectors are neurons that respond to specific visual stimuli such as edges, lines, or movement. An example is edge detectors in the visual cortex that respond to the outline of objects.'
			},
			{
				type: 'short-answer',
				question:
					"How do visual feature detectors support both the nativist and the empiricist position of how 'knowledge' is formed?",
				answer:
					'Feature detectors support nativism because they suggest that certain neural mechanisms are innate. They support empiricism because experience fine-tunes these detectors based on exposure to the environment.'
			},
			{
				type: 'short-answer',
				question:
					'What are the three types of changes that can occur in the brain as a result of learning? Describe some research that provided evidence for ONE of those changes (your choice).',
				answer:
					'The three types of changes are synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and changes in neural networks. Research on synaptic plasticity, such as studies of long-term potentiation (LTP), shows how repeated activation of synapses strengthens them, aiding memory and learning.'
			},
			{
				type: 'short-answer',
				question: 'Whatâ€™s the difference between ideas being stored locally or being distributed?',
				answer:
					'Local storage of ideas suggests that specific memories or knowledge are stored in particular parts of the brain. Distributed storage suggests that memories and knowledge are spread across multiple regions of the brain, with many neurons involved in each memory.'

				type: 'short-answer',
				question:
					'Differentiate between the terms sensation and perception and outline how we know there are more than five senses.',
				answer:
					'Sensation refers to the detection of stimuli, while perception involves the interpretation of those stimuli. Beyond the five senses, humans have other senses, such as proprioception (body position), vestibular sense (balance), and nociception (pain).'
			},
			{
				type: 'short-answer',
				question:
					'Understand how stimuli in the physical world get converted into neural signals our brain can process.',
				answer:
					'Stimuli are detected by sensory receptors, which convert the physical energy (e.g., light, sound, chemicals) into electrical signals through a process called transduction. These signals are then transmitted via neurons to specific areas of the brain for processing.'
			},
			{
				type: 'short-answer',
				question:
					'Outline the theories that have been made throughout history during the study of sensation and perception.',
				answer:
					'Throughout history, theories such as empiricism (the idea that perception is learned through experience), nativism (the idea that perception is innate), and the Gestalt principles have shaped our understanding of sensation and perception.'

			},
			{
				type: 'short-answer',
				question:
					'Define the phrase time to collision. How does the size-arrival effect change our perception of collision times?',
				answer:
					'Time to collision refers to the estimated time before an object impacts another. The size-arrival effect changes our perception by making larger objects appear to move slower, leading to misjudgment of collision times.'
			},
			{
				type: 'short-answer',
				question: 'What is the doctrine of specific nerve energies?',
				answer:
					'The doctrine of specific nerve energies states that the nature of perception is defined by the pathway that sensory information takes to the brain, rather than the type of stimulus. For example, activating the optic nerve results in visual sensations, even if the stimulus is not light.'
			},
			{
				type: 'short-answer',
				question:
					'What is the difference between the direct perception and information-processing view?',
				answer:
					'Direct perception suggests that we perceive the world directly from the sensory information available without needing internal mental processes, while the information-processing view posits that perception involves the brain actively interpreting sensory data.'
			},
			{
				type: 'short-answer',
				question: 'What is phenomenology and why is it so difficult to address in science?',
				answer:
					'Phenomenology is the subjective experience of perception, or how things feel to us. It is difficult to address scientifically because it deals with personal, internal experiences that cannot be objectively measured.'
